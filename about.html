      <h2>The Reason</h2>
      <p>
        Created to fill a void, DD Plumbers was established by Darren Daniel in early 2012. Darren could see a space in his local plumbing sector for a professional, highly skilled workforce to provide both domestic and commercial plumbing services. However,
        to create his vision, Darren had to build it from the ground up.
      </p>

      <br>

        <h2>The Founder</h2>
        <p>
          Darren began an apprenticeship in plumbing with Advanced Heating, a local plumbing firm, at the tender age of 16. At this point in his life Darren had two burning passions, plumbing and rugby. At 18 years of age Darren was offered the opportunity to embark
          on a career playing professional rugby for the Llanelli Scarlets. Just as any young individual would have, Darren jumped at the opportunity and began what heâ€™d hoped would be a long, successful career in professional rugby. Playing in both the
          Magners League and Heineken Cup, Darren progressed quickly.

        <h2>The Accident</h2>
        <p>
          At just 24 years of age he was forced to retire due to a disastrous knee injury. This news came as a devastating blow. As a result, Darren was forced to completely rethink the path he had chosen. Fortunately, the skills he had developed during his apprenticeship
          were there for him to fall back on. However, Darren did not simply fall back on these skills, he used them as a springboard.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br>
      <h2>The Then</h2>
      <p>
        In February 2012 Darren founded, what was then called, Darren Daniel Plumbing and Heating with nothing more than a set of tools, a car and his own plumbing skills. Darren soon realised his vision of creating a large, reputable company with a professional
        working environment and so, he began his journey to creating his vision. In order to grow rapidly and expand with purpose, professionalism and attention to detail were, and still are, at the top of the agenda.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>
        Darren never forgets his time as a team member of the Llanelli Scarlets and is still extremely grateful for the opportunities, friendships and skills he developed during his time at the club. The team working skills developed whilst playing are a unique
        set of skills that Darren now uses on a daily basis to motivate and manage his own team.

      <h2>The Now</h2>
      <p>
        Today DD Plumbers consists of 10 full time plumbers and heating engineers, a fleet of 6 vans on the road daily, 1 permanent office space and a team of administration staff. However, we are still just getting started. In the next year we are looking to
        double the size of our highly qualified team whilst keeping our attention to detail and professional standards to the highest level of quality. DD Plumbers is now both domestic and commercial Gas Safe registered (previously Corgi), Oftec Oil registered
        and LPG Gas Safe registered.
