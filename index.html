        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
          At DD Plumbers we implement a structured, transparent pricing system that ensures the cost of your job will always be individually assessed. We use a specific set of criteria to ensure that every job we price is as fair as the next, removing the guesswork
          and reassuring you that every aspect of your job has been considered.
          <br>
          <br> We feel that clarity is essential to any successful process. In light of this, we will always provide our customers with a thorough breakdown of the work to be carried out, thus keeping you and our team on the same page. It is because of this
          methodic working style that DD Plumbers has established an enviable reputation that few companies are able to match.

        <h2>Where are we</h2>
        <p>
          We are based in Llanelli, but we love to travel. Members of our team can often be found fixing leaks and installing boilers in and around Llanelli, Swansea, Cardiff, Carmarthen, Pembroke and the majority of the South West Wales area. With our fleet of
          vans on the road daily you're never out of reach.
